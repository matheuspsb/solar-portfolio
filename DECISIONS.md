# Decisions

## Versions (verified on npm / official docs, 2026-10-03)

next 16.3.8 · react/react-dom 19.3.0 · three 0.186.1 · @react-three/fiber 9.8.1 · @react-three/drei 10.7.9 ·
@react-three/postprocessing 3.1.3 · babel-plugin-react-compiler 1.0.0 · vitest 5.0.3 · @playwright/test 1.63.0 ·
@react-three/test-renderer 9.1.1 · eslint 9.39 · prettier 3.9 · typescript 5.9.

- **TypeScript 5.9 instead of 7.0:** 7.0 is the native port; the lint/Next toolchain is validated on 5.x. Stable choice.
- **ESLint 9 instead of 10:** eslint-config-next 16 targets the flat config on ESLint 9.
- **pnpm 9.15** (available). Node 22.12.

## React 19 and React Compiler

- React Compiler is **stable** (react.dev) and Next.js 16 supports it via `reactCompiler: true` plus
  `babel-plugin-react-compiler`. Memoization comes from the compiler (build plugin), not from React 19 itself.
- Enabled globally. Do **not** use `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`React.memo` by default; only with a measured or
  semantic reason (e.g. stable identity for a library), with a comment.
- Escape hatch: `'use no memo'` directive per component/hook (compilationMode `annotation` is the opt-in alternative).
  Any component that needs it for R3F `useFrame` mutations will be documented here.
- React 19 features: `ref` as a prop (no `forwardRef`) is used by atoms; `use`/Actions/`useOptimistic` have no real
  problem to solve in this phase (no async data, no forms) so they are not used.

## Tooling

- `id-length` ESLint rule (min 2) enforces the "no one-letter names" rule; `no-console` and `no-explicit-any` are errors.
- Playwright uses SwiftShader flags so WebGL works in headless Chromium.
- The foundation smoke tests could not be seen failing "for the right reason" because there was no code to fail
  against; from the next iteration on, tests are run red first.

## Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 (user override)

The user asked mid-session to "use tailwind", overriding the CLAUDE.md default of CSS Modules. Tailwind v4
(`tailwindcss` + `@tailwindcss/postcss`) is used; design tokens live in the `@theme` block of
`src/design-system/tokens/tokens.css` (single source of truth; utilities such as `bg-sun-400` derive from it).
Components use utility classes that reference tokens only: no arbitrary hex/px values in components.
The "colocated style file" rule becomes "styles are utility classes in the component file".
Reduced-motion zeroes the duration tokens.

## three pinned to 0.182

`three` 0.186 logs "THREE.Clock: This module has been deprecated" at runtime because @react-three/fiber 9.8.1 still
uses `Clock`. The project requires a clean console, so `three` (and `@types/three`) are pinned to 0.182.0.
Revisit when R3F moves to `THREE.Timer`.

## Scene structure

`SolarSystemSceneLoader` (client) loads `SolarSystemScene` with `next/dynamic({ ssr: false })` and chooses a quality tier
from the viewport width (`lib/scene-quality`). `StarField` keeps an explicit `useMemo` (stable buffer identity for R3F).
